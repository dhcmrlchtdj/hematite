### 01. Introduction

---

> there are two major branches to the study of type systems.
> The more practical, which concerns applications to programming languages, is
> the main focus of this book.
> The more abstract focuses on connections between various "pure typed
> lambda-calculi" and varieties of logic, via the Curry-Howard correspondence.

### 03. Untyped Arithmetic Expressions

---

- three basic approaches to formalizing semantics
    - operational semantics，通过定义一个 abstract machine 来定义如何处理语义
        - structural operational semantics (small-step)
        - natural semantics (big-step)
    - denotational semantics
    - axiomatic semantics

- operational semantics 是目前研究最深入的（？）
- 为什么叫 small-step，因为过程是每次替换一点点 term，直到变成一个 value
