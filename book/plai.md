Including mistakes makes it impossible for you to read passively: you must
instead engage with the material, because you can never be sure of the veracity
of what you’re reading.

it makes sense to provide a long and descriptive name when defining the
datatype (because you probably won’t use that name again)

定义时变量名具体明确，使用时变量名可以简短。
作者这里提供的判断的标准居然是使用的频率。

感觉作用域大小决定变量名长短更合理些。
另外现在自动补全这么强，不需要过分追求短小了吧。
