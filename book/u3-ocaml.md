- syntax
- dynamic semantics
    - approaches to defining the semantics
        - operational semantics
            - describe the computation process
            - many low-level details
        - denotational semantics
            - build the mathematical structure
            - more abstract
    - reduction semantics (a case of operational semantics)
    - small-step operational semantics (Structural Operational Semantics)
    - big-step operational semantics (Natural Semantics)
- static semantics
    - simple types
    - type inference
    - unification (for simple types)
    - polymorphism
- recursion
    - fix-point combinator
    - recursive types
