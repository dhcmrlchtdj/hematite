# ZooKeeper

- introduction
    - ZK is a service for coordinating processes of distributed applications
    - ZK provides
        - a per client guarantee of FIFO execution of requests
        - linearizability for all requests that change the ZK state
    - ZK can be used to implement configuration, group membership, leader election, lock
        - lock can be used to implement group membership, leader election
    - use replication to archive high available and performance
    - wait-free data objects organized hierarchically as in file systems
    - guarantee FIFO client ordering of all operations
    - only writes are linearizable
        - leader-based atomic broadcast protocal, Zab
    - ZK application is dominated by read operations and it becomes desirable to scale read throughput
        - servers process read operations locally, do not use Zab to totally order them
    - caching data on the client side
        - watch mechanism, a client can watch for an update to a given data object

- ZooKeeper service
    - terminology: client, server, znode
        - znode is in-memory data node, organized in a hierarchial namespace
        - example: /A/B/C
    - znode types: regular, ephemeral
        - ephemeral znode will be deleted when session closed
        - client can set sequential flag when creating a new node
            - 假设新节点 /p/n_x，那么 /p/n_x 的 seq 不会小于 /p 之前创建的子节点
    - watch
        - watches are unregistered once triggered or the session closes
        - 一次性的，且和 session 绑定的
    - session
        - a client connects to ZK and initiates a session
        - 靠 heartbeat 检测 session 状态，timeout 就干掉 session
        - session 能在 server 之间转移，保证 client 不受 ZK 节点变化影响
    - client API
        - all methods have both a synchorous and an asynchronous version
        - all update methods take an expected version number for conditional updates
            - 就像浏览器的 conditional requests, If-Match 的玩法
    - guarantee
        - two basic ordering guarantees
            - linearizable writes
                - A-linearizability (asynchronous linearizability)
                - all requests that update the state of ZK are serializable and respect precedence
            - FIFO client order
                - all request from a given client are executed in the order that they were sent by the client
        - client A/B may see different configuration
            - slow read (sync + read)
            - sync causes a server to apply all pending write request before processing the read
    - example
        - configuration management
            - 存储配置的 znode 节点 Z_cfg，客户端读取的时候加上 watch。之后变更就会提醒客户端
        - group membership
            - 靠 ephemeral 自动删除异常节点
            - 客户端获取节点列表，就能知道有哪些可用节点。也可以加上 watch 监控节点变化情况
        - lock
            - 创建 ephemeral 的 lock file，后续操作使用 sync 版本
            - 如果创建失败，说明其他程序持有锁。可以用 watch 监控其他程序何时释放锁。
            - 这种 watch 会唤醒所有等待锁的程序。要优化可以配合 sequential，每个程序都等待之前一个锁，避免被一起唤醒。
        - read/write lock
            - 和普通 lock 差不多，给 read/write 分别创建锁。然后和普通的读写锁检查一样

- ZooKeeper implementation

- conclusion
    - wait-free by exposing wait-free objects to clients
    - read-dominant workload
    - weak consistency guarantee

- performance
    - throughput
    - latency of requests

- use case
    - configuration metadata
    - failure detect and group membership (track the status of the master and slaves)
    - leader election (handle master failover)
