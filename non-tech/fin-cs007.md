## 2. predictably irrational

主要讲了一些谬误

- confirmation bias
    - 只相信自己相信的
    - 相反的证据被忽视
- hindsight bias
    - 高估自己预测能力
    - 回顾、复盘时，发展方向好像都很明显，但预测未来的并没有更精准

- gambler's fallacy, 赌徒谬误
- herd behavior, 从众
- overconfidence, 自负
- overreaction, 过激
    - overreact to recent events
- availability bias/heuristic, 一叶障目
    - 做判断的依据其实并不完整，但自认为证据已经完整了
- loss aversion (prospect theory)
    - we hate losses more than we love winning
    - we hate being responsible for decisions that could result in a loss
- it's ok to not be rational
    - humans are predictably irrational
    - know your own flaws
    - self awareness is key
