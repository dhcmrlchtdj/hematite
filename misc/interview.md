> What Are We Looking For
> are they someone we want to work with?

- be nice. courteous and pleasant
- be clear. simple and to the point
- know what you don't know. appropriate levels of confidence
- know your language.
- remember CS 101.
- think about real computers.

> What We Don't Look For

- perfection
- mental math
- logic puzzles

> some candidates just don't have the background for the job they are applying for.
> The solution to that is to learn more, and practice more.


- they're careless.
    - candidate didn't think carefully and systematically about how their program might go wrong.
- they talk more than they code.
- they don't generalize
    - if we point out that you missed a case, consider other cases you might have missed.
    - if we remind you of an invariant you forgot, find a way to protect yourself from making the mistake in other places in your code.

> Build something - from scratch - in a language you like. Don't stop short. Build the whole thing.
> Show it to the smartest people you know, get feedback, tear it down and build it again with what you've learned.
> Repeat with a new problem.

- most important is the ability to write clean and correct code

- BEFORE YOU START CODING
    - Make sure you understand the problem.
    - Work through simple examples.
    - Make a plan.
    - Choose a language.
- WHILE YOU’RE CODING
    - Think out loud.
    - Break the problem down and define abstractions.
    - Delay the implementation of your helper functions.
    - Don’t get caught up in trivialities.
- ONCE YOU HAVE A SOLUTION
    - Think about edge cases.
    - Step through your code.
    - Explain the shortcuts you took.

> You’ve given an O(n^3) solution and your interviewer asks you to do it faster.
> You stare at the problem, but nothing’s coming to you.

- Start writing on the board. Anything is better than nothing.
- Talk it through. If you're stuck, talking is one way out of it.
- Think algorithms.
- Think data structures.
- Think about related problems you’ve seen before and how they were solved.
- Modify the problem by breaking it up into smaller problems.
- Don't be afraid to backtrack.

- fit
- generalism
- architecture
- coding

> Take your time preparing.
> Do code katas and practice interviewing with friends.
> Try solving the interview questions on our site.
> See our tech talks to get a feel for how we do things and the scale of problems we're trying to solve.

> Hard training makes for an easy battle.

- warm-up
    - long-term, study and practice for a week or two before the interview.
        - study a data-structures and algorithms book.
        - have a friend interview you.
    - short-term, get lots of rest the night before, and then do intense, fast-paced warm-ups the morning of the interview.
        - spend at least an hour practicing immediately before you walk into the interview
- mental
    - humble, open-minded, and focused.
    - feel free to ask for help or hints if you're stuck.
    - it's OK (and highly encouraged) to ask a few clarifying questions
    - don't take too long before actually solving the problem
- tech
    - the best tip is: go get a computer science degree.
    - Algorithm Complexity
    - Sorting
    - Hashtables
    - Trees
    - Graphs
    - Other data structures
    - Math
    - Operating Systems
    - Coding
    - Other Stuff
