- functional reactive programming (FRP)
    - functional reactive programming is programming with values that change over time.
- self-adjusting computation (SAC)
    - Self-adjusting computation refers to a model of computing where computations can automatically respond to changes in their data.

- both FRP and SAC are about computations with changing inputs
- FRP is history-sensitive and SAC is not
