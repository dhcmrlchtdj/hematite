## Software Leadership #1: Code Speaks; Love the Code

---

> The best people in software have an innate ability to communicate using code.
> They have an idea and simply code it up, thereby making it reality.

> Those who love code should be developers, and be proud of it.

---

- mediocre mid-level manager syndrome

> I’ll admit that when you manage large enough teams, you have to give up on a
> bit of coding.
> I will personally never give it up entirely, even as I manage teams of 1,000s
> of engineers.

- code is beneath me

> “I’ve been a professional developer for 10 years, so my job is now to tell
> others what to do rather than doing anything myself.”
> At this point, they might adopt the title Architect.

- I manage things, I don’t build them.

> But when it comes to software, everything really does need to be grounded by
> the code, else decisions are often disconnected and damaging.

---

> I have the utmost respect for people who have fallen into any of these traps,
> but then realizes it and gets out.

作者列举了三种他觉得不合理的场景。
关键是要发现问题然后走出来。

> Finally, I do encourage software leaders to read as much code as they can.
> Reading code is a great way to learn how things work, and to stay on top of
> what’s actually happening in your project.
> And it keeps your mind fresh, and often leads to new ideas.

---

## Software Leadership #2: Authority is an Illusion

---

> The very notion of “authority” is 90% in your head.

> telling everybody how they are doing things wrong is a recipe to not only get
> you off on the wrong foot, but also permanently poison your relationship with
> what would have been very important allies down the road.

> The employees I love the most are those that ask tons of questions and aren’t
> afraid to tell me when I’m wrong.

---

不要畏惧权威？
还是不要给自己设限？
有问题直接指出？

---

## Software Leadership #3: A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats

---

> there’s only a finite (read: small) number of truly amazing software
> developers in the world

> you should always strive to hire better and better people.
> This applies to an entire company as well as individual teams.

---

寻找优秀的员工。
（其效果不会仅是线性的，会更好

---

## Software Leadership #4: Slow Down to Speed Up

---

> remembering to take the necessary time to do the right thing

---

## Software Leadership #5: Blur the Line Between Research and Engineering

---

> there ought not to be a distinction between software research and software
> engineering.

> The first is theoretical computer science, and the second is applied computer
> science.
> I actually do agree that they require two very different skills.
> The former is mathematics. The latter isn’t really science per se; rather,
> it’s really about engineering.

理论与应用的不同在于，前者基础是数学，后者是工程。

> Worst case, and perhaps more likely, the paper will get filed underneath the
> “interesting ideas” bucket but never really change the industry.

主要是认为只做研究，只输出论文，很难影响到工业界。

---

## Software Leadership #6: Read Every Checkin

---

> (Reading the code) won’t give you a complete picture of the design and
> architecture.

靠代码本身，不容易弄清楚系统的设计。
之前和新人交流的时候，用这个做理由，建议不要直接研读源码。

> reading code is the most effective way to understand the inner workings of
> your team at a very intimate level.

作者这里建议看 commit 情况，更多是为了了解团队的情况吧

---

## Software Leadership #7: Codevelopment is a Powerful Thing

---

> I am aware of Conway’s Law – and teams exist for a reason (to lump together
> closely related work) – but the reality is the organization almost always lags
> behind the technology.
> Technology direction should shape the organization, not vice versa.
> Communication structures need to be put in place to facilitate this.

> What an incredible opportunity to learn more about Y, and collaborate closely
> with some new colleagues, that is all-too-often missed!

---

## Software Leadership #8: Empower Bottom-Up Innovation

---

> No matter how smart of a leader you are, you’re going to be wrong sometimes.
> Often even. And you won’t always have the best ideas.

> there are people with better ideas, who are smarter than you, in your group,
> anyway.

> It’s critical to create an environment where the best ideas are heard,
> discussed, and ultimately able to grow into things that are much bigger.

我个人是认为，领导者应该做的事情就是提供环境。（这种印象大概来自于 GIS
团队的领导，是团队对外的接口，为团队成员提供最舒适的环境。

> Having bottom-up innovation doesn’t mean anybody does whatever they want, but
> it does mean every idea gets its fair day in court.

---

## Software Leadership #9: On the Importance of Intellectual Honesty

---

> The best engineers and leaders I’ve worked with have an insatiable curiosity
> for how things work, a desire to discover how to do things better, and
> fundamentally understand that careers are about a lifetime of learning.

> If you don’t know something, it’s an opportunity to learn, not cover up the
> fact you don’t know.

---

## A few thoughts on the role of software architects

---

> An architect at a startup may be more like a tech lead, checking in code like
> mad, but also keeping the rest of the team in check.
> An architect at a medium sized IT shop might focus on connecting disparate
> business systems together at a high level, but without diving down into code.
> And a software architect at Microsoft can play an even varied number of roles
> because the company is so large and diversity of projects so great.

小型公司，中型公司，大型公司，架构的不同意义。

> an architect is the guy (or gal) who is in charge of making those decisions
> which, if made incorrectly, could sink the project.

感觉这个可以和之前看到的一个 senior 定义对比一下。
能解决问题的是 junior，能发现问题的是 senior。
这里，决策能决定项目生死的，称得上 architect。

> An architect’s success is measured by what he or she ships to customers, and
> not by the amazing ideas that were ultimately never realized.

---

### 0. Inspire and empower people to do their best work.

> You can’t do it all yourself.
> This is a tough pill to swallow.
> But it’s a sad fact of life that you need to learn to be comfortable with.

> Architects should also welcome all ideas with open arms.

> an architect who won’t even entertain new ideas from the team often drive
> away the best engineers. Great engineers hate to be told what to do. They
> don’t want to feel like they are walking in the shadows of somebody else.

> Part of your role as the team’s architect is to recognize who on the team has
> the most potential, and to arrange for them to have as much leeway and
> creative freedom as possible.
> You don’t want to end up with a bunch of lackeys whose job is to “just
> implement” your ideas, because you’ll get what you paid for.

### 1. Oversight, but not dictatorship.

> In fact, the architect may have very little to say over specific project
> management, scheduling, and budget decisions, but is typically on the senior
> leadership team for the project.

> The initial vision and idea is far from a shipping solution, and software
> engineering only gets interesting once you actually try to build something.
> Ideas are cheap.

### 2. Taste is a hard thing to measure, but is invaluable.

> engineering is more of an art than a science

> In fact, good taste is perhaps one of the most important skills an architect
> needs to have.

> In my best estimation, good taste can be learned from paying close attention
> to the right things, taking a step back and viewing designs from afar often
> enough, being learned in what kinds of software has been built and was
> successful in the past, and having a true love of the code.

### 3. Write code and get your hands dirty.

> If you’re not writing actual product code, you’re not an architect: you’re an
> ivory tower has-been, and probably doing more damage than you are helping
> matters.

> People need to respect your abilities, and you want your team to look up to
> you.
> You want them to come and ask for your advice because they want it, and enjoy
> it, and not force them to deal with you simply because of your position on the
> team.

其他人想要知道你的意见，想要得到你的建议。
这才是团队影响里最直接的体现啊。

### 4. The power of the dyad: know your weaknesses.

> Architects need to play a dual role in understanding both business and
> technical needs and strategy.

业务架构师和技术专家的区别？

> The best architects I know realize their relative weakness on the business end
> of things and partner up with another senior leader with complementary skills,
> to fill in the gaps: this forms a harmonic interval.

> These are things that, being a technology guy (or gal), wouldn’t immediately
> come to mind. But remember: it’s all about the customer.

### 5. It’s for the customer, not you.

> The best engineers often succeed because they focus on scratching a personal
> itch.

> You get to prove your ideas by having real human beings to use the end product.
> If you never get to that state, ... You’re a researcher, not an architect.

### 6. Admit when you’re wrong, fall on your sword, and then fix it.

> Being an architect requires a careful balance between sticking to your guns—
> your guiding principles and technical vision—and realizing when things aren’t
> working out and course correcting before it’s too late.

### In conclusion

> Being an architect, in the end, is all about helping others to succeed.
