## Software Leadership #1: Code Speaks; Love the Code

> They have an idea and simply code it up, thereby making it reality.

> Those who love code should be developers, and be proud of it.

- mediocre mid-level manager syndrome

> I’ll admit that when you manage large enough teams, you have to give up on a
> bit of coding.
> I will personally never give it up entirely, even as I manage teams of 1,000s
> of engineers.

- code is beneath me

> “I’ve been a professional developer for 10 years, so my job is now to tell
> others what to do rather than doing anything myself.”
> At this point, they might adopt the title Architect.

- I manage things, I don’t build them.

> But when it comes to software, everything really does need to be grounded by
> the code, else decisions are often disconnected and damaging.

---

> I have the utmost respect for people who have fallen into any of these traps,
> but then realizes it and gets out.

> Finally, I do encourage software leaders to read as much code as they can.
> Reading code is a great way to learn how things work, and to stay on top of

> And it keeps your mind fresh, and often leads to new ideas.

---

> The very notion of “authority” is 90% in your head.

> telling everybody how they are doing things wrong is a recipe to not only get
> you off on the wrong foot, but also permanently poison your relationship with
> what would have been very important allies down the road.

> The employees I love the most are those that ask tons of questions and aren’t
> afraid to tell me when I’m wrong.

## Software Leadership #3: A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats

---

> there’s only a finite (read: small) number of truly amazing software
