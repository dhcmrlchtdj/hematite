## Software Leadership #1: Code Speaks; Love the Code

---

> The best people in software have an innate ability to communicate using code.
> They have an idea and simply code it up, thereby making it reality.

> Those who love code should be developers, and be proud of it.

---

- mediocre mid-level manager syndrome

> I’ll admit that when you manage large enough teams, you have to give up on a
> bit of coding.
> I will personally never give it up entirely, even as I manage teams of 1,000s
> of engineers.

- code is beneath me

> “I’ve been a professional developer for 10 years, so my job is now to tell
> others what to do rather than doing anything myself.”
> At this point, they might adopt the title Architect.

- I manage things, I don’t build them.

> But when it comes to software, everything really does need to be grounded by
> the code, else decisions are often disconnected and damaging.

---

> I have the utmost respect for people who have fallen into any of these traps,
> but then realizes it and gets out.

作者列举了三种他觉得不合理的场景。
关键是要发现问题然后走出来。

> Finally, I do encourage software leaders to read as much code as they can.
> Reading code is a great way to learn how things work, and to stay on top of
> what’s actually happening in your project.
> And it keeps your mind fresh, and often leads to new ideas.

---

## Software Leadership #2: Authority is an Illusion

---

> The very notion of “authority” is 90% in your head.

> telling everybody how they are doing things wrong is a recipe to not only get
> you off on the wrong foot, but also permanently poison your relationship with
> what would have been very important allies down the road.

> The employees I love the most are those that ask tons of questions and aren’t
> afraid to tell me when I’m wrong.

---

不要畏惧权威？
还是不要给自己设限？
有问题直接指出？

---

## Software Leadership #3: A Rising Tide Lifts All Boats

---

> there’s only a finite (read: small) number of truly amazing software
> developers in the world

> you should always strive to hire better and better people.
> This applies to an entire company as well as individual teams.

---

寻找优秀的员工。
（其效果不会仅是线性的，会更好

---

## Software Leadership #4: Slow Down to Speed Up

---

> remembering to take the necessary time to do the right thing

---

## Software Leadership #5: Blur the Line Between Research and Engineering

---

> there ought not to be a distinction between software research and software engineering.

> The first is theoretical computer science, and the second is applied computer science.
> I actually do agree that they require two very different skills.
> The former is mathematics. The latter isn’t really science per se; rather, it’s really about engineering.

理论与应用的不同在于，前者基础是数学，后者是工程。

> Worst case, and perhaps more likely, the paper will get filed underneath the
> “interesting ideas” bucket but never really change the industry.

主要是认为只做研究，只输出论文，很难影响到工业界。

---

## Software Leadership #6: Read Every Checkin

---

> (Reading the code) won’t give you a complete picture of the design and architecture.

（靠代码本身，不容易弄清楚系统的设计。这是之前和新人交流时，不推荐新人去研读开源代码的理由。

> reading code is the most effective way to understand the inner workings of
> your team at a very intimate level.

作者这里建议看 commit 情况，更多是为了了解团队的情况吧

---

## Software Leadership #7: Codevelopment is a Powerful Thing

---

> I am aware of Conway’s Law – and teams exist for a reason (to lump together
> closely related work) – but the reality is the organization almost always lags
> behind the technology.
> Technology direction should shape the organization, not vice versa.
> Communication structures need to be put in place to facilitate this.

> What an incredible opportunity to learn more about Y, and collaborate closely
> with some new colleagues, that is all-too-often missed!

---

## Software Leadership #8: Empower Bottom-Up Innovation

---

> No matter how smart of a leader you are, you’re going to be wrong sometimes.
> Often even. And you won’t always have the best ideas.

> there are people with better ideas, who are smarter than you, in your group, anyway.

> It’s critical to create an environment where the best ideas are heard,
> discussed, and ultimately able to grow into things that are much bigger.

我个人是认为，领导者应该做的事情就是提供环境。（这种印象大概来自于 GIS
团队的领导，是团队对外的接口，为团队成员提供最舒适的环境。

> Having bottom-up innovation doesn’t mean anybody does whatever they want, but
> it does mean every idea gets its fair day in court.

---

## Software Leadership #9: On the Importance of Intellectual Honesty

---

> The best engineers and leaders I’ve worked with have an insatiable curiosity
> for how things work, a desire to discover how to do things better, and
> fundamentally understand that careers are about a lifetime of learning.

> If you don’t know something, it’s an opportunity to learn, not cover up the
> fact you don’t know.
