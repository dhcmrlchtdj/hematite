binary tree
binary heap

heapsort
    - optimal for both time and space
    - not stable
    - poor use of cache memory

---

symbol table
- key-value pair abstraction
- use immutable types for symbol table keys
- implements
    - unordered linked list
    - ordered array / binary search
    - binary search tree

---

binary search tree
- binary tree in symmetric order
- larger than all keys in its left substree,
    smaller than all keys in its right subtree
- tree shape depends on order of insertion
