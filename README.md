# sia tsei

I created this project because I decided to write down my notes on github.

'sia tsei' means 'write' in Fuzhou dialect and 'pieh' means 'pen'.

It will be a long time to develop 'pieh'.
I may finish it one day.

------

+ `src` store markdown source files.
+ `static` store static file include css and javascript.
+ `template` store the template.
+ `post` store published html files.
+ `pieh` store the app to update all posts.

------

pieh is depended on tornado.template now.
I will write a tempalte myself oneday.
