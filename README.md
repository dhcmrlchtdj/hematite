# sia tsei

i start this project because i want to write down my notes in somewhere.

'sia tsei' means 'write' in Fuzhou dialect and 'pieh' means 'pen'.

------

`src` store markdown source files.
`posts` store published html files.
`layout` store static file and template.
`pieh` is the app used to convert markdown to html
then pass the html to template to generate the post.

------

it will be a long time to develop 'pieh'.i may finish it one day.
