- RxJS
    - unified the world of push-based collections
    - great for event-based workflows where the data can be pushed at the rate of the producer
- IxJS
    - unifies both synchronous and asynchronous pull-based collections
    - great at I/O operations where you as the consumer can pull the data when you are ready
